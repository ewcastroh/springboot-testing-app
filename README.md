   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

## API Endpoints
TBD (to be documented as the project progresses)

## Testing
Testing strategies using Spring and Spring Boot testing tools will be documented here.

## OpenAPI Specification
Open URL: 
```url
http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`
```

Customize the path in application.properties using the springdoc.api-docs property. For example, we can set the path to /api-docs:
```properties
springdoc.api-docs.path=/api-docs
```

Then, weâ€™ll be able to access the docs at:
```url
http://localhost:8080/api-docs
```

By default, the OpenAPI definitions are in JSON format. For yaml format, we can obtain the definitions at:
```url
http://localhost:8080/api-docs.yaml
```

### Swagger UI
Open URL: 
```url
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

Support for swagger-ui Properties
```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```
